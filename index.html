        <h1>Formula 1 Race Analysis Assistant</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the documentation for the Formula 1 Race Analysis Assistant! This application provides an interactive platform for analyzing Formula 1 race data using the FastF1 API. With this tool, users can visualize and analyze various aspects of Formula 1 races, from position changes to team pace comparisons.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>The application provides the following features for comprehensive Formula 1 analysis:</p>

        <h3>Position Changes During the Race</h3>
        <p>
            This feature visualizes how drivers' positions change during the course of a race. It plots the position of each driver lap-by-lap, allowing users to track the progression of the race and identify critical moments, like overtaking, safety car periods, or pit stops. This feature is useful for understanding race dynamics and key race events.
        </p>

        <h3>Fastest Laptime Comparison</h3>
        <p>
            Compares the fastest lap times of two selected drivers from a given session. It plots the speed of each driver over time, allowing users to see where one driver might be faster than another. This feature helps analyze performance differences, driving styles, and strategic choices.
        </p>

        <h3>Tyre Strategy Visualization</h3>
        <p>
            This feature provides insights into a driver's tyre strategy during a session. It plots lap times against lap numbers, with points colored based on tyre compounds. This helps to understand tyre choices, pit stop strategies, and the impact of different compounds on performance. 
        </p>

        <h3>Gearshift Map</h3>
        <p>
            Visualizes the fastest lap of a selected driver with color-coded lines representing gear shifts. This feature maps the track layout and shows where and how frequently gear shifts occur during the fastest lap. It's useful for analyzing driving styles and assessing a driver's approach to different track sections.
        </p>

        <h3>Tyre Strategy During the Race</h3>
        <p>
            This feature visualizes the tyre strategies of all drivers during a race. It shows which compounds each driver uses, along with the stint lengths. This can provide insights into overall race strategies, pit stop timing, and tyre management.
        </p>

        <h3>Top 10 Driver Laptimes Scatter Plot</h3>
        <p>
            Compares lap times of the top 10 finishers in a race. This feature displays a scatter plot of lap times, allowing users to compare performance among the top finishers. It can indicate consistency, tyre degradation, and strategic variations.
        </p>

        <h3>Team Pace Comparison Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            This feature compares the lap times of different teams during a race. It uses a box plot to show lap time distributions for each team, offering insights into team performance and strategy during the race.
        </p>
